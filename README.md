                  It is a conceded fact that one feels delighted being in a free atmosphere, beyond any bondage of routine life.And a picnic with friends is something very enjoyable and amusing. 
                  During the last summer holidays, a group of my cousins arranged a picnic at seaside. All of us voted in favour of  Mubarak Village. Ishban my dearest cousin hired a coaster.
                  All the necessary ahd been made by Saturday night. We ahd food,fruit and other items with us in adequate quantity. Five crates of cold drink, two water coolers filled with ice,dishes,cutlery football and other playing goods were also with us.
                 We set early in the morning to enjoy the beauty of nature. Ishban was making every one laugh with his gags. Their faces were shining brightly. After we had reached the Mubarak Village, we felt relaxed. A cool breeze was blowing. 
                 First we hired the hut , put all things there and rushed to the water. Some of us began to swim and take bath in the cold water. It was very pleasnt to play with dancing waves. Then we enjoyed by playing cricket and football.
                 As it was Sunday, people wre rushing to this point madly. There was a great hustle and bustle of the people. It grew more and more till noon. After play we got tired badly and were feeling hungry, So we rushed to our hut, took rest & then we had our lunch.
                 Lunch was very delicious. We took fruit and enjoyed with cold drink. After lunch we strolled along the shore in the pairs. Time passed swiftly, we enjoyed every moment of this picnic. As it was getting dark so we returned to our home with sweet memories of this picnic.
